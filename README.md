# Matrix-Transformations-DEs
My cousework scored 100% in ECM1416 Computational Mathematics module. 
The coursework consisted of two questions, the first deals with matrix transformations and makes use of the python numpy library to do this. 
Question 2 consists of an inital value problem, wherein we have a ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) to solve using Euler's method.
