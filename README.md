# Matrix-Transformations-DEs
My coursework scored 100% in the ECM1416 Computational Mathematics module. The coursework consisted of two questions, the first deals with matrix transformations and makes use of the python NumPy library to do this. Question 2 consists of an initial value problem, wherein we have an ODE (Ordinary Differential Equation) to solve using Euler's method.
